While the success of the deep learning relies on huge amount of labeled sample, labeling each time/event as profitable or unprofitable, under the transaction cost, especially in the high-frequency trading world, suffers from serious label imbalance issue. In this paper, we adopts rigurious end-to-end deep learning framework with comprehensive label imbalance adjustment methods and succeed in predicting in high-frequency return in the Chinese future market. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/Label-Unbalance-in-High-Frequency-Trading .
