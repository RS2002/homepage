I'm a senior undergraduate at [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), with a GPA of 90/100, specializing in Robot Reinforcement Learning under [Prof. Kai Huang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2466). I'm also involved in Music AI with [Prof. Ning Liu](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/node/2495) and [Prof. Chengying Gao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2537). Currently, I'm a visiting student at the [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/) linked to the [Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans), focusing on Wifi Sensing under the guidance of [Dr. Guangxu Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/guangxuzhu). In Fall 2024, I'll begin my Ph.D. journey in [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Sen Li](https://lisen1990.wixsite.com/senli).  And my current research mainly focuses on Wifi Sensing and Robot Reinforcement Learning.

Aside from academics, I'm a music enthusiast, having been a lead singer and guitarist in bands like [NEWS](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=52253597) and [Rights of Lethe](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=52435898). If you share my passion for heavy rock music, feel free to contact me via Weibo or email. You can also find our music videos on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/349124347?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0).
