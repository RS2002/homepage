I am a senior undergraduate in [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) (GPA:90/100 ,National Basic Subject Talent Training Plan) supervised by [Prof. Kai Huang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2466) and [Prof. Ning Liu](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/node/2495). Currently, I am studying at [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/), associated with [Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans) as a visiting student under the supervision of [Dr. Guangxu Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/guangxuzhu).

My research interests span a wide range of AI, and I am eager to explore various fields during my undergraduate studies. I am currently seeking an opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of AI, with a strong passion for computer science and mathematics. I am open to exploring any interesting field during my Ph.D. as I believe that the most important aspect of my doctoral studies is to develop my learning and research skills.

If you would like to learn more about my previous research, please feel free to download my CV or contact me directly. I would greatly appreciate any opportunity to join a research group.
