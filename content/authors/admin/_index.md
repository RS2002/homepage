I'm a Ph.D. student in [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk/) and [Center for Scientific Computation](http://www.csc.ust.hk/scc/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Sen Li](https://www.smartcityhkust.com/). My current research primarily focuses on Deep Reinforcement Learning, Intelligent Transportation, Mobile Computing, and AI Ethics.

I received my B.Eng. degree from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2024, mentored by [Prof. Kai Huang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/HuangKai) (Robot RL), [Prof. Ning Liu](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/LiuNing) and [Prof. Chengying Gao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/GaoChengying) (Music AI). I was also a visiting student in [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans)  from 2023 to 2024, under the guidance of [Prof. Guangxu Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/guangxuzhu) (Deep Wireless Sensing).

Aside from academics, I'm also the vocalist and guitarist for several metal and rock bands, including [Tokamak Disruption](https://tokamak-disruption.netlify.app/), [NEWS](https://tokamak-disruption.netlify.app/author/news/) (personal band) and [Rights of Lethe](https://tokamak-disruption.netlify.app/author/rights-of-lethe/) (dissolved). If you are interested in collaborating with me (whether in academia or music), please feel free to reach out!
