I'm currently a visiting student at the [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/) associated with [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/zh-hans), focusing on Wi-Fi Sensing and Intelligent Network Optimization under the guidance of [Dr. Guangxu Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/guangxuzhu). In fall 2024, I'll begin my Ph.D. journey in [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.ust.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), under the supervision of [Prof. Sen Li](https://lisen1990.wixsite.com/senli).  

Prior to this, I received my B.Eng. degree from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Kai Huang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2466), [Prof. Ning Liu](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/node/2495) and [Prof. Chengying Gao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2537).

Aside from academics, I'm a music enthusiast, having been a singer and guitarist & bassist in bands [NEWS](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=52253597) (current my personal band) and [Rights of Lethe](https://music.163.com/#/artist?id=52435898) (dissolved). And I'll join a rock \& metal band in fall 2024 at HKUST. I have a strong passion for heavy rock music, particularly alternative punk, melodic death metal, dark metal, and some core genres. If you are interested in playing or collaborating with us, please feel free to reach out to me via Weibo or mail.
